# Object-oriented-programming-Specialization
Develop Object Oriented programming and data handling skills in C++ through an exciting worked example

#Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in C++
by University of London & Goldsmiths, University of London

About this Course
This course is the first of five courses aiming to help you to become confident working in the object-oriented paradigm in the C++ language. 

This specialisation is for individuals who want to learn about object-oriented programming. It's an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of C++, all the way to building a crypto-currency exchange platform.

During the five courses, you will work with the instructor on a single project: a cryptocurrency exchange platform. Whilst building the project, you will learn about a range of programming techniques from basic control flow and input/output through to file parsing, object-oriented techniques, and user interaction on the console. 

In this first course, you will get started with C++ by writing, building and running your first program. You will then learn about text input/output, if statements and loops by building an interactive menu system for the crypto-currency exchange platform. Upon completing the course, you will be able to:

* Write, compile and run a C++ program that prints messages to the console
* Use the standard library to do text I/O in the console
* Write and call simple functions
* Use a while loop to repeatedly receive and respond to user input
